You will need to do some  independent reading on this topic if this is your first exposure to QTL  mapping. The recombinant inbred strains that we are using in WebQTL and in  this particular demo were generated about 25 years ago by Dr. Ben Taylor at  The Jackson Laboratory. He crossed a female C57BL/6J mouse with a male DBA/2J  mice. At the bottom of this slide we have schematized one chromosome pair  from three out of 80 BXD RI strains.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;  </span>The dashed vertical lines that lead to the final BXD RI lines involve  20 full sib matings (about 6 years of breeding). Some lines die<span  style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>out during inbreeding. For example,  there is no extant BXD3 or BXD4 strain.</font><br>  </td> </tr></table></body></html>
