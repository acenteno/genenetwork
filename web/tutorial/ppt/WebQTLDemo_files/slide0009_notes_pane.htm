In this case, we have used green lines between transcripts that  have positive correlations, and red lines between transcripts that have  negative correlations. Correlations have been multiplied by 100. The  correlation of 0.96 between App and Hsp84-1 reads 96.<span  style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These are Pearson product moment  correlations and they are sensitive to outliers. If you prefer, you can  recompute Spearman rank order correlations.</font><br>  </td> </tr> <tr>  <td colspan=1></td>  <td align=left colspan=1><br>  </td> </tr> <tr>  <td colspan=1></td>  <td align=left colspan=1><font face=Helvetica size=2>Where did Ndr4 (lower  left) come from?

Vertical number on  the right side of each box: this is the probe set ID given by Affymetrix. We  have truncated these probe set IDs so you will not see the usual<span  style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>“at”. A single gene may be  represented by more than 10 probe sets.

Read this as:  App has a suggestive QTL on Chr 2 at about 140 Mb and the D allele inherited  from DBA/2J confirms a higher expression level at this marker.<span  style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If there is no star symbol, then it  is not even formally “suggestive” but does make an interesting looking blip  on the QTL radar screen.</font><br>  </td> </tr></table></body></html>
