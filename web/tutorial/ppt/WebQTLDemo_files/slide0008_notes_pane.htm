A very large number of transcripts have correlations above 0.7 (absolute  value) with App mRNA. The precise number today is 208. But this will change  as we add more strains and arrays. In any case, this is a fairly large number  and all of these correlations are significant at alpha .05 even when  correcting for the enormous numbers<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;  </span>of tests (12422 tests).</font><br>  </td> </tr> <tr>  <td colspan=1></td>  <td align=left colspan=1><br>  </td> </tr> <tr>  <td colspan=1></td>  <td align=left colspan=1><font face=Helvetica size=2>What does this imply?</font><br>  </td> </tr> <tr>  <td colspan=1></td>  <td align=left colspan=1><br>  </td> </tr> <tr>  <td colspan=1></td>  <td align=left colspan=1><font face=Helvetica size=2>That there can be  massive codependence of expression variance among transcripts. App is NOT an  isolated instance. This is improtant biologically and statistically. From a  statistical perspective, we would like to know how many “independent” test we  effectively are performing when we use array data in this way. Are we testing  12000 independent transcripts or just 1200 transcriptional “modules” each  with blurred boarders but each with about 10 effective members. There is no  answer yet, but we probaby have a large enough data set to begin to answer  this question.</font><br>  </td> </tr></table></body></html>
