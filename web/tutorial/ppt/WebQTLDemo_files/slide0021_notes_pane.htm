For sake of argument, lets say that we are  confident that the polymorphism is located between 130 and 150 Mb (20 Mb,  equivalent to roughly 10 cM). There will typically be 12 to 15 genes per Mb,  so we now would like to evaluate 240 to 300 positional candidates. We would  like to highlight the biologically relevant subset of candidates. We could  look through gene ontologies and expression levels to help us winnow the  list. An alternate way avaiable using WebQTL is to generate a list of those  genes in this 20 Mb interval that have transcripts that co-vary in expression  with App expression.</font><br>  </td> </tr> <tr>  <td colspan=1></td>  <td align=left colspan=1><br>  </td> </tr> <tr>  <td colspan=1></td>  <td align=left colspan=1><font face="Times New Roman" size=4>To do this, go  back to the Trait Data and Editing window. Sort the correlations by position.  Select Return = 500. Then scroll down the list to see positional candidates  that share expression with App.</font><br>  </td> </tr> <tr>  <td colspan=1></td>  <td align=left colspan=1><br>  </td> </tr> <tr>  <td colspan=1></td>  <td align=left colspan=1><font face="Times New Roman" size=4>There are  several candidates that have high correlation with App even in this short 20  Mb interval. We can rank them by correlation, but they are all close.<span  style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There is one other imporant approach  to ranking these candidates. Are they likely to contain polymorphisms? We can  assess the likelihood that they contain polymorphisms by mapping each  transcript to see if any have strong cis QTLs. The logic of this search is  that a transcript that has a strong cis-QTL is likely to contain functional  polymorphisms that effect its own expression. This make is more like that the  transcript is a “causative” factor since it is likely to be polymorphic.</font><br>  </td> </tr> <tr>  <td colspan=1></td>  <td align=left colspan=1><br>  </td> </tr></table></body></html>
