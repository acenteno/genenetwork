But again, due to the 10 to 20 Mb precision of the mapping data, this  relation could be generated by a large number of other polymorphisms close to  Hars2. In the absence of a biological connection between Actn2 and Hars2 we  have a weak hypothesis. If there were a plausible functional connection  between the two genes, then this hypothesis could be quickly upgraded.</font><br>  </td> </tr></table></body></html>
