These so-called  genetic maps are scaled in centimorgan (recombinations per 100 gametes). In contrast,  the physical map shown below the genetic map has an X-axis scale based on DNA  length measured in nucleotides or base-pairs. Notice the large difference  between the two maps in the size of Chr 19 (large on the genetic scale but  small on the physical scale).</font><br>  </td> </tr> <tr>  <td colspan=1></td>  <td align=left colspan=1><font face=Verdana size=2>Also notice the large  difference in the width of the chromosome 7 QTL peak. In mice, recombinations  occur with higher frequency toward the telomeric side (right side) of each  chromosome. As a result, genetic maps are stretched out more toward the  telomere relative to a physical map. The QTL on distal Chr 7 is therefore  actually more precisely mapped than might appear looking at the genetic map.</font><br>  </td> </tr> <tr>  <td colspan=1></td>  <td align=left colspan=1><font face=Verdana size=2>The physical scale is  becoming more useful than the genetic scale primarily because many other data  types can be easily superimposed on a physical map. You will see more  examples in the next several slides.</font><br>  </td> </tr></table></body></html>
