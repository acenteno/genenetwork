These modulatory regions  of the genome are sometimes called quantitative trait loci or QTLs. You may  want to do some independent reading on this topic if this is your first  exposure to QTL analysis.</font><br>  </td> </tr> <tr>  <td colspan=1></td>  <td align=left colspan=1><font face=Verdana size=2>The genetic reference  population (GRP) of BXD recombinant inbred strains were originally generated  about 25 years ago by Benjamin Taylor at The Jackson Laboratory. He crossed  female C57BL/6J mice with male DBA/2J mice to generate the F1 and F2 progeny.  At the bottom of this slide we have schematized one chromosome pair from  three of the BXD RI strains.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The  dashed vertical lines that lead to the final BXD RI lines involve 21 full sib  matings (about 7 years of breeding). Some lines die out during inbreeding.  For example, there is no longer any BXD3 strain.</font><br>  </td> </tr> <tr>  <td colspan=1></td>  <td align=left colspan=1><font face=Verdana size=2>Notes:</font><br>  </td> </tr> <tr>  <td colspan=1></td>  <td align=left colspan=1><font face=Verdana size=2>1. Over the last decade,  our group (Lu Lu and Rob Williams) and Jeremy Peirce and Lee Silver at  Princeton have enlarged Ben Taylor’s set. There are now just over 80 BXD  strains. They have all been genotyped using about 13,700 markers (SNPs and  microsatellites). These markers are used to define the “blue” and “red”  regions of the chromosomes as shown in the figure above.</font><br>  </td> </tr> <tr>  <td colspan=1></td>  <td align=left colspan=1><font face=Verdana size=2>2. Chromosomes of RI GRPs  usually have about 4 times as many recombinations as those of F2 animals.  However, unlike an F2, both chromosomes of an RI are identical. Therefore, 50  RI strains contain as many recombinations as 100 F2 animals.</font><br>  </td> </tr> <tr>  <td colspan=1></td>  <td align=left colspan=1><font face=Verdana size=2>3. BXD43 through BXD100  were generated using a special method that resulted in a further doubling of  the average recombination density per chromosome. The entire set of 80 BXDs  therefore contains as many recombinations as about 260 F2 animals.</font><br>  </td> </tr></table></body></html>
