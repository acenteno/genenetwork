APP is a great  transcript to introduce you to the complexity and power of new array  platforms that often provide “alternative” expression estimates for single  genes. There are seven probe sets that target different parts of the APP  transcript. Which of the alternative measurements is most appropriate and  informative? Have a look at the FAQ page for more on this topic, but general  advice: 1. be skeptical and try to validate that the correct transcript and  gene is being measured; 2. check what part of the transcript is complementary  to the probes; 3. evaluate the performance of individual probes based on  expression level, signal-to-noise and other error terms such as the standard  deviation and error.</font><br>  </td> </tr> <tr>  <td colspan=1></td>  <td align=left colspan=1><font face=Helvetica size=2>2. In this particular  case we have highlighted and selected # 5 on this SEARCH RESULTS page. The  annotation for this probe set mentions that it targets the last three exons  and the 3’ untranslated region (UTR) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP).<span  style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That is just what we want.</font><br>  </td> </tr> <tr>  <td colspan=1></td>  <td align=left colspan=1><font face=Helvetica size=2>3. Most probe sets have  not been annotated in as much detail as App. Refer tot the FAQ to learn how  to annotate probe sets yourself.</font><br>  </td> </tr></table></body></html>
