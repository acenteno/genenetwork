In this case,  BXD8 is a potential problem. An outlier of this type may be generated by a  technical artifact (bad sample?). However, it is also possible that BXD8 just  has genuine low endogenous expression of App and may therefore be a  particularly valuable model for research. There are different ways to treat  problematic data of these types. One way is simply to discard this datum. The  other way is to prevent outliers from have too much influence quantitatively,  while leaving them in their low (or high positions). This is called  windsorizing the data (after King Henry the VIII who had a habit of chopping  heads). In this case, we have windsorized the BXD8 to a value of 16.0 and the  BXD33 to a value of 16.02. Rank is retained. We are making a bet that the two  lowest strains are really low, but we are hedging our bet and just making  them a little lower than BXD90. This removes their “undue” influence.</font><br>  </td> </tr> <tr>  <td colspan=1></td>  <td align=left colspan=1><font face=Helvetica size=2>Notes:</font><br>  </td> </tr> <tr>  <td colspan=1></td>  <td align=left colspan=1><font face=Helvetica size=2>1. It turns out that  BXD8 is a strain with many odd phenotypes. The whole strain is essentially an  outlier for many traits. Therefore, the low App expression data may be quite  accurate. Still, it would be comforting to have at least two more replicates.</font><br>  </td> </tr></table></body></html>
