<P>PRELIMINARY SUMMARY (private data): One of a set of two expression data sets by Alfons Jake Lusis and colleagues (UCLA) generated using two sets of Recombinant Inbred strains.


<P>General information and background for BXD and BXH UCLA Cartilage data sets:
<OL>
<LI>BXD UCLA data sets
<LI>BXH UCLA data sets
</OL>

<P>All mice were maintained on a 12 h lightâ€“12 h dark cycle and fed ad libitum.

<P>Mice were killed at XX weeks, and tissues, including the cartilage were immediately collected and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen.

<P>All procedures of housing and treatment of animals were performed in accordance with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee regulations (UCLA).

<P><B>Array design and preparation of labeled cDNA and hybridizations to microarrays for the mouse tissue samples.</B> RNA preparation and array hybridizations were performed at UCLA using Illumina Mouse 6 version 1.1 arrays.

<P>Mouse cartilage was homogenized, and total RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's protocol. ADD MORE.

<P>Arrays were quantified using Illumina Rank Invariant protocol and normalized to a mean of 8 units and a SEM of all probes to 2.0 units (a modified Z score).


<P>Data entered by Evan Williams (July 24, 2008).

<P>These unapproved notes by RWW, Sept 4, 2008.
