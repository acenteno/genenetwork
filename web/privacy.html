The GeneNetwork system records some information about how the site is used such as the IP address of machines accessing data sets. This information is used to monitor our system performance, to prevent abuse of the system, to enforce usage limits explained by the Usage Policy, and to guide further development of the GeneNetwork. This information is stored on the server in files that are accessible to members of the GeneNetwork development group. Specific information will not be released.

When you visit the GeneNetwork, your use of the site is recorded in two ways. First, your use is logged by the Web server in standard log files. The IP address of your machine, the date and time, and the name of the page you visit
are recorded. Second, for each request from the SQL database, the GeneNetwork records your IP number, the time, and the data set from which you request information. This information is collected for statistical purposes. Our system uses a software program (Analog) to create summary statistics that we find helpful in assessing patterns of data use, in measuring system performance, and in detecting problem. This information is used to provide you with better internet service. 

<P>GeneNetwork also may request permission to place a so-called 'cookie' text file on your system to allow you to retain information on your set-up preferences.

When you submit trait information to GeneNetwork for on-line analysis, that information is not recorded permanently; data are discarded as soon as your calculations are finished and the page of results is returned. Data can be stored permanently, but only if you have permission to add data to the GN databases.
